# Getting started with Firebase

Go to [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) with whatever email you gave me and sign into the console. You should see a project that is something like IFixit Ad Server. The firebase DB that is used here will be how we store all of our user data. I've already done some authentication so you can just run

-   npm install
-   npm run dev

To run the linter run npm run format through the console
