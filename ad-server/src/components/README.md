# Getting started with developing using React

## Creating Components

1. Create a folder with the name of your component in the ManagementPage folder
2. Create a jsx file with the same name as your component in the folder you just made
3. Create a css file with the same name as your component in the folder you just made
4. See ManagementPage.jsx for simple formatting of a jsx file

## Viewing Components

1. Run `npm start` from the project directory
2. Import your component to ManagementPage.jsx
3. Create your component in ManagementPage.jsx
4. Save and you'll see the app will rerender

**Note: If your component is supposed to render when clicking a button (i.e. a Modal), contact Jack for help with testing**
